		// what we can sense is code

		// so far because what can be safely/correctly interpreted by the runtime/machine/crow is code - not pixels - we'd have to tell it how to interpret those pixels
		// (it knows what code means because code is its reality - we'd have to give those pixels code-sense/meaning)
		// the machine is already doing something useful - executing code in an environment which gives it x, y, z capabilities
		// so as it senses/interprets the code it invokes its (arms, feet, hands, legs, mouth) => (output: pixels, chars, translations, files, sound, etc, further codes)
